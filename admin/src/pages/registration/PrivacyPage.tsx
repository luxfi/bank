<p><span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Privacy policy notification to 3rd parties</span></p>



<p>Although the information on Connected Parties and/or Recipients is stored for a certain period of time in compliance with applicable law, we will not use it to market to the non-registered person. Additionally, these persons have the same rights to access and correct information about themselves as registered users of CDAX. You should bring this Privacy Policy to their attention at the earliest opportunity so they aware of how their information will be processed by us and aware of their rights in relation to that information.</p>



<p><strong>Information about you that we receive from third parties</strong></p>



<p><span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Fraud prevention checks</span></p>



<p>To protect ourselves and our customers against fraud, we verify the information you provide with Anti-Fraud Agencies and Electronic Identity Verification Services. In the course of verification, we receive information about you from such services.</p>



<p>If you register a debit card or bank account with CDAX, we will use card authorisation and anti-fraud screening services to verify that your bank or card information and address match the information you supplied to CDAX, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p>



<p><span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Identity verification using Electronic Verification Providers</span></p>



<p>Any electronic identity check with a credit agency may leave a record on your credit file. By agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you agree that we may carry out such searches in the knowledge that it may leave a record on your credit history. If you are a joint account holder, in certain circumstances credit agencies may link your record with your spouse, partner or other financial associates.</p>



<p><span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Background checks</span></p>



<p>We conduct a background check on all our customers (and for business customers, also on the business’s directors, shareholders and partners). During this process we will obtain information about you and/or your business, its directors, shareholders and partners, from an identity verification provider.</p>



<p><span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Social media</span></p>



<p>If you allow us to, we will collect friend lists from Facebook and similar information from other third parties such as Twitter and Google – the app will periodically re-collect this information in order to stay up-to-date – and we may collect other information you have chosen to make publicly available on social media sites. Where we are one of your connections on a social media site, we may also connect information you have chosen to share with your connections on that site.</p>



<p><span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Information about you from other sources</span></p>



<p>We may also collect information about you from other sources, including other companies (subject to their privacy policies and applicable law), and from other accounts we have reason to believe you control.</p>



<p>We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we, or our group companies, operate or the other services we provide. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners and affiliates, customers who participate in our refer-a-friend programme, service providers, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers) and may receive information about you from them. This may be combined with the information you provide to us.</p>



<p>We will use information we receive from business partners for marketing purposes only if you have provided your consent to do so, either to the third party which collected the information, or to us.</p>



<p><strong>Sensitive data</strong></p>



<p>Data privacy regulations prohibit the processing of ‘special categories of personal data’, also called ‘sensitive data’ unless you have given your consent.</p>



<p>Sensitive data includes information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, and data concerning health, sex life or sexual orientation. There are also restrictions on processing of criminal convictions and offences.</p>



<p>To avoid infringing these restrictions, it is CDAX’s policy that we do not ask for or collect any of the above data from you or any other party, so we therefore ask that you please do not reveal any sensitive data about yourself or others in any communication with us. If you do reveal sensitive data, for example by phone or in an email, you will be giving express consent for us to process that information by storing the recording of the telephone call, or the email or other communication.</p>

<p><strong>5. Sharing information with third parties</strong></p>



<ul><li>To support our business and provide services to you</li><li>Just like most banks and financial/payment service providers, CDAX works with third-party service providers (including banking partners and banking intermediaries) who provide important functions that allow us to make our money transfer services easier, faster, and safer.</li><li>This includes business partners under contract with us who support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service, contract administration and technology services. We need to disclose user data to them from time to time so that the services can be performed. Our contracts dictate that these business partners only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li><li>By accepting this Privacy Policy and maintaining an account with CDAX, you expressly consent to the transfer of your data to those third parties for the purposes listed.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Banks and payment providers</strong></p>

<p><strong>Where required by law</strong></p>



<ul><li>We may disclose necessary information to the police and other law enforcement agencies, security forces, competent governmental, intergovernmental or supranational bodies, competent agencies, departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or organisations, and other third parties, including CDAX Group companies, where we are legally compelled and/or permitted to do so.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Mergers and acquisitions</strong></p>



<ul><li>As with any business, it is possible that in the future CDAX could buy, merge with, or be acquired by, another company.

If we refer you, we will typically pass on your name, email address and telephone number.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Third party websites</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to the websites of our business partners, advertisers and affiliates.</li><li>If you request a quote directly on a third-party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly through CDAX’s website) may be shared with the owner of any such third party website.</li><li>Please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies. Please check those policies before you submit any information to third party websites.</li></ul>



<p><strong>6. Transfering data overseas</strong></p>



<p>CDAX is committed to adequately protecting your information regardless of where the data resides and to providing appropriate protection for your information where such data is transferred outside of the EEA.</p>



<p>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored in, a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of your request, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>



<p>The laws in some countries may not provide as much legal protection for your information as in the EEA. In these circumstances, our policy to protect your data is to rely on findings of adequacy by the European Commission (for countries in scope of those findings), the EU-US Privacy Shield (for transfers to the USA) or standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or the IOM Information Commissioner (for all other countries).</p>

Once we have received your information, we will use protective procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>



<p><strong>7. Data retention</strong></p>



<p>We are obliged by our regulators to retain account data for 6 years after the closure of an account. In some circumstances, such as an enquiry from a law enforcement agency, we may have to hold it longer. We may also retain information if required to protect our interests, for example in case of litigation. When data falls outside those retention periods we will take steps to delete it from our system. Where you have asked us not to contact you, we will retain that information on a ‘do not contact’ list to reduce the risk of us contacting you in the future.</p>



<p><strong>8. Systems security policy</strong></p>
